# Django Blog Website

This is a blog website created using the Django Framework following these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p

I was able to learn the basics of the framework and deployment as well as add on to the existing website with features such as the like button.

* Note:
* This web app uses free Heroku dynos, meaning it will sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. This means the first time loading the app will be long, but subsequent loads will be faster.
